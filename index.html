 <p>
  Here are links to some projects I have completed so far.  I am just beginning my software engineering journey, 
  so I am creating these projects primarily to practice new skills and techniques as I learn them.
  As my knowledge of software engineering grows the scope of the projects will grow as well.  
  
  I have included some bullet points to provide some details about each project and some of the techniques I have applied in creating them. 
  I will focus particularly on new skills I have learnt, or ones for which I used the project to practice.
  I will periodically update the list with new projects that reflect my progress.
